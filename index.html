            <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time !</h2>
            <p class="text">Adventure is a thrilling experience which increases the excitement and the rush of adrenaline in the blood. It also refers to an activity that is exciting, exhilarating and having some element of risk. Mountain bike riding, Para gliding, swimming, parachute jumping, and dirt racing are some of the examples of adventurous activities. Adventure is often pursued for psychological improvement and also to gain knowledge and experiences as in case of exploration and jungle safaris. Adventure involves risk yet people long for it because of the boost it gives to one’s confidence and mood. It is surely good to be adventurous unless it is done after carefully analyzing the risk involved.
            <br><br>
            Adventure is the experience of some exciting activities. It is the unusual experience which comes from the activities full of courage, excitement and joy. It never thinks about the result. It may result positively which gives some benefits and negatively which hurts and make losses. However, adventurous people never mind the result and continue their adventure. Adventure exists in everything however it differs in the people’s mind. Adventurous people think about the adventure as a new chance and opportunity to go ahead and get success or experiences through failure however coward people take it as a fearful act and never try to do.</p>

                <h2 class="discr">BIKING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Cycling (also known as bicycling or biking) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of transport, more so in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa. In Europe, cycling is predominantly a recreational activity. The continent is very much the hub of cycling as a competitive sport, but modern Europeans are increasingly inclined to use the bike as a favoured mode of transport (from home to office – and back). Indeed, across the world today, the cycle is the preferred means of conveyance for many commuters. Compared to the ubiquitous motorcar, cycles contribute almost nothing to air or noise pollution, besides giving the rider plenty of opportunity to get in some exercise. In cities, bikes help lessen traffic congestion and assist in solving seemingly perennial parking problems, as well as offering easier manoeuvrability.

            The beauty and diversity of India – both natural and architectural – can best be experienced on a saddle. A cycle tour in the mountains and forests, or through national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, can make for a charming (and unforgettable) introduction to India.</p>

                <h2 class="discr">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.
                <br><br>
            First you have to take the parachute to the hill where you will make your jump. Be aware that the weight of parachute can vary between 6-15 kg. When you climb up the hill, all you need is a paragliding wing. As the paragliding pilot, you should be careful to make sure that the field is not obstructed by anything such as trees or structures. The paragliding pilot should run down the hill, and there is no need to run too fast because the wind will help enough already. The type of sports parachute used in paragliding is designed for easier take off and landing. </p>

                <h2 class="discr">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">The sport of surfing is completely based on the types of maneuvers surfers make while riding the waves. Some of the common types of maneuvers are, cutbacks, carving, floater, tube ride, and top-turn. To successfully ride a wave, the surfers need to accurately judge the shape of each wave, the strength and direction of the wind, height of the tide, the current and many other variables.
            <br><br>
            In professional surfing competitions, surfers are judged based on several factors: commitment, degree of difficulty, innovative and progressive maneuvers, combination of major maneuvers, variety of maneuvers, speed, power and flow of the ride. Each ride is adjudged by a panel of judges, and is awarded points between 5 to 10. The two highest scoring rides for each surfer is totaled to determine the winner of the competition.</p>
